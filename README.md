# odin-recipes
This is a basic recipe website which I started by making a landing page that links to the recipes on the site. Once linked I focused on creating the recipes making sure to change the titles to the appropriate title for each recipe then added a appropriate haead for each recipe as well. Added a picture that is described for people with screen readers and adjusted the size of each. Added summaries under each picture. Theres a unordered list for each ingredient and ordered lists for the the directions. There is a home button that directs back to the landing page on each recipe site above the picture and at the bottom of the page for easy access.
